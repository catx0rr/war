                <p>
                    I've worked as a technical support role and some system administratrion for 5 years. After such time,
                    I wanted to be part of the growing industry of cybersecurity and become as a penetration tester myself
                    but it takes a great amount of effort and prowess studying and practicing the digital arts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the help of some friends, and for my love in open source, I decided to broaden up my skill by studying 
                    the technologies and end up practing programming. I taught myself how to program in Python for a couple of
                    months and some web technologies like HTML CSS and a bit of JavaScript. I also use Linux, as part of my main arsenal.
                </p>
                <p>
                I play some CTF games for past time to learn more about security from <strong><a href="https://hackthebox.eu">hackthebox</a></strong> 
                and <strong><a href="https://tryhackme.com">tryhackme</a></strong> a penetration testing platform to train cyber skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I am looking for a job in the IT industry, but more in a cybersecurity enviroment to help me develop my skills
		    while I contribute to the organization's productivity.
